# Advent of Code Rust Solution

This solution aims to write elegant, production level code.

- Use functional programming style
- Prefer `map` function over `for` or `loop` statements
- Use `newtype pattern` for better readablity and more strict typecheck
- Use traits for composability
- Use pure functions (which never throw exception) only, except functions in input processing

# Execution
```bash
cd Y2020
cargo run --bin=dayXX
```
